Online Shopping Cart Management System RESTful API with ASP.NET Core and .NET 6
This project provides an example of how to create a Web API using ASP.NET Core and .NET 6 for an Online Shopping Cart Management System. The Web API is a RESTful service that exposes a set of endpoints for managing issues. Additionally, this solution includes a OAuth2 service and Docker container.

**Getting Started**
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/techwithpat/trackingapi.git.](https://github.com/Ndipza/SCMSystem)
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your favorite code editor.
3. Set the SCMSystem project as the startup project.
4. Open a Package Manager Console
5. Make sure the Default project in Package Manager Console is Data
6. Type - add-migration Initial
7. Type - update-database
8. Run the application.
   
The RESTful API uses a Miscrosoft SQL Server Management Studio database to store data but you can choose any EF Core provider you like. 

Run the application. The client application will use the Web API endpoints to perform various operations, including creating and updating issues, adding and deleting comments, and retrieving lists of issues.
